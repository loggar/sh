Exit When Any Command Fails

```
# Any subsequent commands which fail will cause the shell script to exit immediately
set -e

# keep track of the last executed command
trap 'last_command=$current_command; current_command=$BASH_COMMAND' DEBUG
# echo an error message before exiting
trap 'echo "\"${last_command}\" command filed with exit code $?."' EXIT
```

Disable set -e for an individual command

```
set -e

some_command || true
```

Exit Only When Specific Commands Fail

```
exit_on_error() {
    exit_code=$1
    last_command=${@:2}
    if [ $exit_code -ne 0 ]; then
        >&2 echo "\"${last_command}\" command failed with exit code ${exit_code}."
        exit $exit_code
    fi
}

# enable !! command completion
set -o history -o histexpand
```
